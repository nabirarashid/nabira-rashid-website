        I'm Nabira Rashid, a passionate innovator with a love for computer
        science, machine learning, and problem-solving. I enjoy areas of STEM
        that I'm interested in while finding ways to make it more accessible to
        others as well! Whether it's through research, hackathons, or community
        initiatives, I'm always looking for new ways to learn, create, and make
        an impact.{" "}
